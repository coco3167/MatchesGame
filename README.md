Welcome to the Matches Game.

The basis rules are : 
	1) You and IA play aiganst one eachother turn by turn.
	2) You as the player choose the number of matches you'll both play with.
	3) At each turn you and then the IA choose the number of matches to withdraw.
	4) You can withdraw between 1 and 3 (both included) match(es).
	5) Obviously you can't withdraw more matches than they're left.
	6) The one who withdraws the last match left loses.

I hope you will enjoy this game (even a little bit).
