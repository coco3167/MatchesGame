Welcome to the Matches Game.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The basis rules are :

	- You and IA play aiganst one eachother turn by turn.
	- You as the player choose the number of matches you'll both play with.
	- At each turn you and then the IA choose the number of matches to withdraw.
	- You can withdraw between 1 and 3 (both included) match(es).
	- Obviously you can't withdraw more matches than they're left.
	- The one who withdraws the last match left loses.

I hope you will enjoy this game (even a little bit).
